ðŸŽº Share summary with teammates right after a meeting or small discuss
......................................................................

This tip came from a dicuss/meeting about improve integration test automation for exodus-gw. we disscuss the difficult part, easy part, and what can be worked on simultaneously.

After the meeting, I think it would be better to send a summary message in Google chat room for teammates.

Summary should be simple, clear and well-format.

.. code-block:: none

    1. Trigger
    2. write autotests code
    3. access PostgreSQL container(in Pod) in OCP

ðŸŽº Tips for Document
....................

- Attach links to JIRA issue, help teammates get more info easily.

ðŸŽº Dev Env and Debug Strategy 
.............................

When learning language or framework, **Fast Feedback** is important.

A good development environment should consider **long-term maintenance** and **easy to use**.

A good example of complex dev env is `exodus-gw`_. 

- `localstack`_ container used for fake AWS S3 and DynamoDB
- Container platform-sidecar is used as the `reverse proxy`_ (This proxy performs authentication via mutual TLS, and authorization via a static configuration file)
- PostgreSQL container
- `dramatiq worker`_
- `sscg`_ for cert management

The dev env management includes systemd, `tox`_ for cmd mangement(eg. dramatiq), podman for containers
